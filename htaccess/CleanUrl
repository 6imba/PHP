Internet bot :
An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform 
tasks that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could.

web crawler :
A search engine spider, also known as a web crawler, is an Internet bot that crawls websites and stores information for the search engine to index. 
Think of it this way. When you search something on Google, those pages and pages of results can't just materialize out of thin air.

And the really big reason as to why you should use clean URLS:
They allow search engines to spider your site.

Why are spiders so picky?
Search engine spiders usually stay away from messy URLs because chances are the code is really bad on whatever script you use and the spider could 
become stuck in a loop, requesting the same pages over and over and draining you of your bandwidth.

.htaccess is your friend
Anyway, how do we make our URLs clean? Well, you need a server that runs Apache. This solution only works for Apache servers, so Win2k users have 
to go somewhere else for their kicks.
