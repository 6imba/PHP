we have got two files (index1.html and index2.html)
we have Directoryindex index1.html which open index1.html as default file 
but what if we have Directoryindex index3.html 
As we dont have any file called as index3.html it wont have any default file to open so it just opens folder and shows us all the files/directories
which is risky like user can see copy internal files
so here comes use of Enable and Disable Directory with which we can protect our file

Options -Indexes ------> For Localhost
Options +Indexes ------> For Liveserver like Cpannel

You see : 
Directoryindex index3.html
ErrorDocument 404 /RootPHP/htaccess/2.ErrorDocument/error/error_404.html
Options -Indexes

Gives following errors: As we have Forbidden to access internal directory using ==> Options -Indexes
Access forbidden!
You don't have permission to access the requested directory. There is either no index document or the directory is read-protected.

If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.

Error 403

We can also create and redirect currernt error page to user frienldy  403 error page.
