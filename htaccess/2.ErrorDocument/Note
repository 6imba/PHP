If link not found go to userfriendly error page
like http://localhost/RootPHP/htaccess/2.ErrorDocument/1.file/apple.html
as we dont have apple.html file it give following error which is is kind of irritating for normal user :
Object not found!
The requested URL was not found on this server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.

If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.

Error 404
