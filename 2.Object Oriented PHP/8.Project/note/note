//here complete url is : http://localhost/Root%20Folder%20of%20PHP%20Practise/2.Object%20Oriented%20PHP/8.Project/$_Server.php
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] = 	//Returns the Host header from the current request : localhost
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] =  //will give you : /Root%20Folder%20of%20PHP%20Practise/2.Object%20Oriented%20PHP/8.Project/$_Server.php

if(strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "8.Project")!==false){
echo "Url of this file contain '8.Project' which means location of this current file somewhere contain '8.Project'";
}
?>

Therefore, url = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
