public $name; // object_property
public static $sciencetificname ="HomoSepiens",$date;//static_property

public function SetInfo($data1,$data2)// object_method
        {
            $this->name=$data1; // object_property
        }
public static function set_coded_date($data3)//static_method
        {
            self::$date=$data3; //static_property
        }

Instead of $this, for static class_members(variables or functions), we use self, along with scope resolution operator ::
here $date is static property not the property of an object, so we need to refernce to the variable or use $ sign
//object_property name,age. here $ is not needed 
//static_property $sciencetificname. $ is needed



when to use static_proprty and when to use object_property
static_proprty = same property for all template
object_property = different property
