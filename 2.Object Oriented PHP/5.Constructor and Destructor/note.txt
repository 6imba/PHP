A constructor is a member function/method of a class which initializes objects of a class.
Constructor is a special member funtion(function inside class defination) of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class. 
When a class or struct is created, its constructor is called. Constructors have the same name as the class or struct, and they usually initialize 
the data members of the new object.
A constructor is a member function of a class which initializes objects of a class. In C++, Constructor is automatically called when
 object(instance of class) create. It is special member function of the class.
A constructor is generally used to set initial values for any of the fields (aka variables). It may also be used to “set up” anything you need for
 a class when you instantiate it.
The contructor is reponsible to initialize value for object as soon as we create object. Means when we create constructor on any class whenever an
 object of a class is initialized, contructor will automatically invoke.As constructor conctructs the value for the data member of a class it is
  called constructor.

Why constructor is used instead of functions?
<!-- 
here what is difference between __construct() and SetInfo()???
or what is difference between constructor and normal funtion ???
ans : constructor is called at the time when object is initialized where in case of normal function we first create object and then call normal_funtion 
-->


public function __destruct(){} ....// destructor
to run destructor we use function called unset() that will unset or destroy the object that insdie the parenthesis by running the destructor function inside the class.
unset($object1); destroy object1

Is it mandatory to use destructor in a class in php?
