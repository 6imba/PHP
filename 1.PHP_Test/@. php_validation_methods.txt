# 2: PHP include and require Statements
    - It is possible to insert the content of one PHP file into another PHP file (before the server executes it), with the include or require statement.
    - The include and require statements are identical, except upon failure:
        > require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
        > include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue
        > <?php include 'footer.php';?>

    - Use require when the file is required by the application.
    - Use include when the file is not required and application should continue when file is not found.

# PHP File Handling:
    - readfile()
    - fopen(_filename,_executionMode)
    - $myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
        > mode: r,w,a,x,r+,w+,a+,x+
