in PostController.php

in index() method:

$all_posts = Post::all();
into 
$all_posts = Post::paginate(5);



instead of method call all we gives it method call paginate
and pass number of item we want in our page
$all_posts = Post::paginate(5);
#this gives only 5 posts in index page


here, 
url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts gives us list of first 5 blog post as first page
url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts?page=2 gives us list of another 5 blog post after first 5 as second page
url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts?page=8 will give empty filed in post page as we have only 227 post write now and our url requeat is asking for 8th page with 5*8=40 post 

since we are using paginate method now we have access to some of other method that only comes with paginate method
one of them is link which genarate the link with our pagination like next and pre buttons

So in inde.blade.php
	<div class="text-center">
            {!! $allposts->links() !!} //calling link method on our object here
        </div>

	<div class="text-center">
            {!! $allposts->links() !!}   
        </div>


Now order posts by recently added page:
sorting/searching by id is bit faster when it comes to searching in db

   $all_posts = Post::oerderBy('id', 'desc')->paginate(5); ==> with this one line of code there are tons of logic being added to our sql query
