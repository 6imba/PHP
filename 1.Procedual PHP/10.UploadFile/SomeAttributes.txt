entype="" ==> It is the attribute used in form that specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server.
	      The enctype attribute can be used only if method="post".	
e.g : <form action="***" method="POST" entype="multipart/form-data" >
HTML forms provide three methods of encoding.
1.application/x-www-form-urlencoded (the default)
2.multipart/form-data
3.text/plain


$_FILES["choosenfilename"] ==> super_global_variable which gets all the information of the selected file.
e.g:
<form action="upload_file.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="selectedfile" id="file" />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
action="upload_file.php"
<?php
if ($_FILES["selectedfile"] > 0)//if file is selected and there is any info about that file named as selectedfile..
  {
  echo "You have selected a file to upload";
  }
?>


when we  write print_r($filedetial); and upload the file it give  following output:
Array ( [name] => robben.jpg [type] => image/jpeg [tmp_name] => C:\xampp\tmp\php172.tmp [error] => 0 [size] => 395539 )
[tmp_name] => C:\xampp\tmp\php172.tmp ---- this is tmeporary name as ue havent set the location where the file need to be uploaded
[error] => 0 --- means no error


explode() : The explode() function breaks a string into an array.
#CODE
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<?php
$str = "Hello world. It's a beautiful day.";
print_r (explode(" ",$str));
echo "<br>";
print_r (explode(".",$str));
echo "<br>";
print_r (explode("'",$str));
echo "<br>";
print_r (explode("",$str));
?> 
</body>
</html>
OUTPUT:
Array ( [0] => Hello [1] => world. [2] => It's [3] => a [4] => beautiful [5] => day. )
Array ( [0] => Hello world [1] => It's a beautiful day [2] => )
Array ( [0] => Hello world. It [1] => s a beautiful day. )
