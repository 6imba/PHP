SESSION:

Session helps to maintian an account in a websites.
If you want to make such type of website in which firstly user have to (signup_OR_create an account) and then login to their respective account anytime to access data then SESSION comes in use.

So what is session then???
Session is a super_global_varaible.It is different than other normal varaible.As we know that if we create a normal variable than we can use it within that particular page only whereas if we create super_global_variable SESSION in one certain page than we can access/use the value store in that session from various other pages...

Steps for SESSION in php:-
1. session start
2. assign value in session
3. fetch value from session (Fetch  means 'to go and get'.e.g: "fetch me the newspaper, Billy".)
4. destroy session


Step 1 : session start
You have to start session in the first line of every page where you want to use Session by writing the session function ==> i.e session_start().

#CODE
<?php session_start(); ?>


Step 2 : assign value in session
Firstly start session by session function ==> session_start();
It is same like assigning value in variable.As session is super_global_variable we write it in this way $_SESSION['']="";
$_SESSION['key/name']="value";
$_SESSION['email']="simba@gmail.com";
In this way we have assign a value("simba@gmail.com") in session with key('email').Now when i want to fetch email/value("simba@gmail.com") from other pages then i have to provide the key('email') to that each page.

#CODE
<?php
    session_start();
    $_SESSION['email']="simba@gmail.com";
    echo "Session started and assigned value(simba@gmail.com) in session key['email'] !!!.";
?>


Step 3 : fetch value from session
Firstly start session by session function ==> session_start();
As we know that we assign session value in one page and fetch it from another page.Now i want to fetch value of Session.
Its easy to fetch session value.We create a varible and  store the value of session in it.
For that we have to write .... $newly created variable name = $_SESSION['key where we have stored value']
i.e : $mail = $_SESSION['email']; ==> {Therefore $mail="simba@gmail.com"}

Now firstly we need to call/open the file where we have assign the value of session, then after we have to open the file through which we can fetch the session.

#CODE
<?php
    session_start();//compalsary if we frogot to start session then this page will not define $_SESSION['email'];
    	$mail = $_SESSION['email'];
    	echo "Firstly here also session is started.If we frogot to start session then this page will not define $_SESSION['email'];<br>.Hello World I am the file that fetches the value of session stored in another file(1.SessionAssign.php)<br>.Here we fetch the value stored in key['email']  from the (1.SessionAssign.php) file and the store it in new varible mail in this 2.SessionFetch.php)<br>Therefore, "."$"."mail = ".$mail;
?>


Step 3 : destroy session
As we said firstly we have to start session in every page where we want to use session even though if it is to destroy session.
so firstly start session by session function session_start();
Then destroy session using session function ==> session_destroy();

#CODE
<?php
    session_start();//session starting function
    session_destroy();//session destroying function

    echo "session destroyed!!!"
?>



SUMMARY:-
1. we start session,
   we assign value in session.
   open assign file it will assign value  in session

3. we start session,
   we fetch value from session.
   open fetch file it will go and get value from another file where value is assign in session
   now whenever you open this file directly it will show the result that has been fetched
   if we open fetch file directly without opening assign file at first then it will show error that undefined index:['key'] as session has not been assigned.

4. we start session,
   we destroy session.
   open destroy file and it will destroy session
   now if you open fetch file after the session is destroyed then it willshow error of undefined index:['key']  as session has been destroyed.
