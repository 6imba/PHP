SESSION:

Session helps to maintian an account in a websites.
If you want to make such type of website in which firstly user have to (signup_OR_create an account) and then login to their respective account 
anytime to access data then SESSION comes in use.

So what is session then???
Session is a super_global_varaible.It is different than other normal varaible.As we know that if we create a normal variable than we can use it 
within that particular page only whereas if we create super_global_variable SESSION in one certain page than we can access/use the value store in 
that session from various other pages...

Steps for SESSION in php:-
1. session start
2. assign value in session
3. fetch value from session (Fetch  means 'to go and get'.e.g: "fetch me the newspaper, Billy".)
4. destroy session

Step 1 : session start
You have to start session in the first line of every page where you want to use Session by writing the session function i.e session_start().
<?php session_start(); ?>

Step 2 : assign value in session
It is same like assigning value in variable.As session is super_global_variable we write it in this way $_SESSION['']="";
$_SESSION['key/name']="value";
$_SESSION['email']="simba@gmail.com";
In this way we have assign a value("simba@gmail.com") in session with key('email').Now when i want to fetch email/value("simba@gmail.com")
 from other pages then i have to provide the key('email') to that each page.

Step 3 : fetch value from session
As we know that we assign session value in one page and fetch it from another page.Now i want to fetch value of Session.
Its easy to fetch session value.We create a varible and  store the value of session in it.
For that we have to write .... $newly created variable name = $_SESSION['key where we have stored value']
i.e : $mail = $_SESSION['email']; ==> {Therefore $mail="simba@gmail.com"}

Now firstly we need to call/open the file where we have assign the value of session, then after we have to open the file through which we can 
fetch the session.

Step 4 : Destroy/ unset session
session_destroy();

Here are 3 files inside this Session folder.
iif you run file 1 it assign session variable and then if you run file 3 it destroy sessoion and finally if you run file 2 error as session
 has already been destroy no session variable initialized
